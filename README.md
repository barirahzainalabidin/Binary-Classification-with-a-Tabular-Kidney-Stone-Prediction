# c. Classify which patient has positive kidney disease


- True Positive (TP): Patients correctly predicted to have kidney disease. ( 94 patients )

- False Positive (FP): Patients incorrectly predicted to have kidney disease ( 37 patients )

- True Negative (TN): Patients correctly predicted to not have kidney disease. ( 135 patients )

- False Negative (FN): Patients incorrectly predicted to not have kidney disease ( 44 patients )



- From result, The model correctly predicted that 94 patients have kidney disease.
